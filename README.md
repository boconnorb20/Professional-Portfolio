# Professional Portfolio

For my portfolio project.... Round 2, I wanted to display some of the new things I have learned and see where my trials and errors have taken me.  

I have refactored some code from previous assignments. I made many tweaks and changes to the CSS and HTML (along with many errors along the way).

I still have very much to learn in my drive for success. But when I sit back and see the things created I tend to amaze myself sometimes. I do look forward to more things to come.  

Technologies-Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (mainly for ideas)

Food for your Brews was a group project. We made one Repo for this Project. I have attached the deployed site link below. I did the HTML and CSS portions for this project. I am not really fond of the styling colors, but that can all be changed at a later date.

Below are the links for our Project 2. This one proved to be a monster and was an intense challenge. The idea was great amnd we were very excited tpo get this application working. The idea was to have a form for teachers to fill out and update a students behavior and level of the offense. All of this dadta gets tracked and stored for later usage by staff.
