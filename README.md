# Professional Profile

For my portfolio project.... Round 2 I wanted to display some of the new things I have learned and see where my trials and errors have taken me.  

I have refrdactored some code from previous assignments. I made this code mine with many tweaks and changes (many errors along the way).

I still very much to learn in my drive for success. 

Technologies-Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (mainly for ideas)
- I would like to say I implemented Java Script but didn't find in necessary and I do not feel like I am 100% there with my JS skills as of yet.
