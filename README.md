# Professional Portfolio

For my portfolio project.... Round 2, I wanted to display some of the new things I have learned and see where my trials and errors have taken me.  

I have refactored some code from previous assignments. I made many tweaks and changes to the CSS and HTML (along with many errors along the way).

I still have very much to learn in my drive for success. But when I sit back and see the things created I tend to amaze myself sometimes. I do look forward to 
more things to come. My Linkedin is still a work in progress too. I have a friend that is going to help me with a good Professional look to my Linkedin and my resume. 

Technologies-Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (mainly for ideas)
- I would like to say I implemented Java Script but didn't find in necessary and I do not feel like I am 100% there with my JS skills as of yet.

Food for your Brews was a group project. We made one Repo for this Project. I have attached the deployed site link below. I did the HTML and CSS portions for this project. I am not really fond of the styling colors, but that can all be changed at a later date.
