# Proj-2-2021

For my portfolio proiject..... I feel; like this is a work in progress as is life. 

I have refrdactored some code from previous assignments. 

I am still very much have a lot to learn and I will continue to drive forward. 

Some of the code I can make work, some not. It, like anything is going to take some trials and efforts. 

I have ideas and designs of what I'd like to do, I jjst need to find  way to make it all work.
